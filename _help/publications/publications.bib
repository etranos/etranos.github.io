  abstract="This chapter reviews the importance of networks in the innovation process from a spatial perspective. Such networks are part of different scale systems of innovation and are essential to the creation of knowledge externalities. It is well established in the extant literature that innovation does not occur in isolation, and furthermore, interorganizational networks facilitate innovation creation. Social networks, trust, and local embeddedness play key roles in the formation of such networks. In addition, relational perspectives, such as non-geographical proximities, are also vital factors for the creation of innovation networks, the main objective of which is knowledge creation. Important enough, the latter can be approached as crucial production factor in the frame of the knowledge economy. Moreover, scale is an important attribute of such networks, as both local and global links are important in the innovation process.",

  abstract = {Summary Climate change can potentially impact on a wide range of economic sectors and activities. This could be changes in profitability in agriculture or forestry, changes in tourism supply and demand patterns, loss of production due to flooding or the costs of rebuilding infrastructure after extreme weather events. Economic effects can, to a large extent, be thought of as second-order effects of other dimensions of sensitivity. A region that is physically sensitive to climate change will also be economically sensitive to it. For example, if a region's transport infrastructure is sensitive to flooding, this will have effects on its economy as well. In other words, a region's physical and social sensitivity to extreme weather events is usually highly correlated with its economic sensitivity to climate change. ESPON Climate's analysis is focused on those economic sectors that are directly affected by climate change, namely the agriculture, forestry, tourism and energy sectors. For each of these sectors the economic impacts were determined by linking particular indicators of climate change to the sector's importance in a regional economy. After a literature review the relevant indicators are defined, the results of a pan-European assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on the different sectors and regions are presented and discussed.}

  abstract = "Weather has always influenced travel behavior and choices of mode, route, and timing, including cancelation, but climate change and the increasing occurrence of severe weather events which result in frequent and extensive transport disruption add urgency to the task of better understanding the existing and potential resilience of travel behaviors. Meanwhile, new and complex travel behavior trends are emerging, in part due to the development and spread of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) but also in response to other external influences and to technological change within the transport sector. These trends may better be understood through a more holistic view of accessibility: online and via transport modes, in time and in space. This chapter reviews the literature exploring the influence of both daily weather parameters and severe weather events on travel behavior and activity participation. It then considers the parallels and interdependencies between the ICT and transport sectors, and finally reframes existing research into the impact of ICT on productivity, lifestyles, and travel behavior in order to demonstrate the potential for ICT to reduce the level of risk from severe weather impacts for different groups and individuals, increase their ability and propensity to choose more resilient options, and improve adaptation."
