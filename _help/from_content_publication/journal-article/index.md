abstract: This article surveys the literature to explore whether and how internet 
  technologies and applications such as social network sites (SNS)
  support social interactions and, through them, knowledge transfers 
  at different spatial scales and settings. By employing concepts from economic 
  geography and combining them with ideas and empirics from urban sociology, business, 
  and media studies, this article informs urban thinking about the underpinning mechanisms 
  behind SNS-mediated vis-Ã -vis face-to-face knowledge-related interactions and how they 
  mirror but also challenge established spatial patterns of knowledge spillovers.
