My talk on the paper we are working with on together with Christoph Stich and [Max Nathan](http://www.maxnathan.com) on *Modelling clusters from ground up: a web data approach* during the [AI & Cities](https://appliedmldays.org/tracks/ai-cities) track of the [AMLD at EPFL](https://appliedmldays.org/).
The YouTube video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4O1W5Aho7Q).
